 <h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>1. Silence Of the Lambs</h3>
 <p>FBI trainee Clarice hunts serial killer Buffalo Bill, aided by brilliant, terrifying Hannibal Lecter, blending psychology, horror, and suspense classic.</p>

 <h3>2.Salaar</h3>
 <p>A violent, loyal man lives in hiding until his past drags him back into Khansaar, a brutal kingdom ruled by power, betrayal, and bloodlines. His childhood bond with a future king turns into a test of loyalty versus ambition. Politics, gang warfare, and revenge collide. The first part is world-building heavy—slow but deliberate—setting up an explosive continuation.</p>

 <h3>3.Bahubali</h3>
 <p>A prince discovers his royal past, challenges tyranny, avenges betrayal, and reclaims Mahishmati through sacrifice, courage, and destiny fulfilled honor.
